# CS441-Parser

HOW TO USE: (parse "file path")

EX: (parse "/Users/guest/Desktop/CS441/file01.txt")

DISCLAIMER: For some reason, Dr. Racket butchered all of my formatting somehow while I was saving. Thus, the code has no formatting or newlines. 
This racket parser still works for the most part, I was able to parse through everything except the 6th file which I couldn't figure out.

- I used the parser-tools/lex library to handle some tasks: https://docs.racket-lang.org/parser-tools/
- I made a lot of heavy usage of the racket documentation: https://download.racket-lang.org/releases/6.1/doc/
- I also used this guide for general racket syntax: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/racket/
- I used our book quite a bit for general guidance for tokenization and parsing: Programming Language Pragmatics, by Michael
